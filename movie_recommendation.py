# This program is designed to read in a list of movie descriptions and
# compare it against an input description. Based on its similarity score the 
# next movie will be recommended.

    - file_path (str): The path to the file to be read.
     
    Returns:
    - A list containing the lines read from the file.
    
    Raises:
    - FileNotFoundError: if file is not found the current directory. '''

# Function to find the most similar movie:
def find_most_similar_movie(input_description, movie_descriptions):
    '''
    Find the most similar movie description to the given input description
    
    Parameters:
    - input_description (str): the description of the movie to compare.
    - movie_descriptions (list): A list of movie descriptions to compare.
    
    Returns:
    - str: The title of the most similar movie.
    
    Note:
    The function uses spaCy's NLP to calculate the similarity scores between
    input_description and each movie_description. It returns the title of the
    movie with the highest similarity score.
